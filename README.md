# Crime Visualizer
This is a visualization project for Stanford CS448B (Data Visualization).

You can find the hosted version here: [https://crimevisualizer.herokuapp.com](https://crimevisualizer.herokuapp.com). The demo is best viewed on Chrome or Safari, and you may have to wait a few seconds for the server to start up.

This visualization was created to give the user an unbiased, highly manipulable view of crime events in San Francisco. It features two markers - one red, one teal - that serve as anchor points on the map. These can be dragged freely and, when overlapped, show all the crime events that occurred in that area. These matching crimes can be further filtered by all of the tools on the right - one can adjust the radius of each marker, limit the matches by day of the week and time of the crime, and also specify which crime types should be included in the matches. To view more detail, one can zoom in and out using their mouse or the zoom buttons. To view the specifics of a crime incident, one can hover over it and additional details are shown.
